Next suppose that the TTTableImageItemCell is configured to display an image url for an image that is, say, 100x200 and is *not* in the image cache.\r\n\r\nWhen the TTTableImageItemCell does layoutSubviews for the first time, it will check to see if the image URL is in the cache. In this case, the image is not in the cache, so it will do the layout based on the dimensions of the placeholder image (70x70 in this example).\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter the TTImageView displays the placeholder image while it sends out an HTTP request for the image resource. At this point the layout is good: the placeholder image fits nicely into the cell. Then, after the image is retrieved from the internet, the image is downsampled to fit inside the existing TTTableImageItemCell frame (70x70 because of the initial placeholder image). At this point, everything is still fine.\r\n\r\nNow scroll the cell off the screen a few rows and then scroll back to the cell. A new cell will be dequeued and set to display the image URL, but *this time* it finds the image in the cache, and follows a different code path through layoutSubviews. The end result is that the TTImageView's frame is now changed to match the dimensions of the cached image (100x200 in this example), and the end result is that the image overflows the cell layout.\r\n\r\nYou can see this problem in my TTRemoteExamples table view. You can verify that the image cache code path in layoutSubviews is the root of the problem by disabling the image cache in TTRemoteExamples (AppDelegate.m sets the cache's maxPixelCount to a farily large number right now).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the correct behavior would be for -[TTTableImageItemCell layoutSubviews] to always set the frame of its TTImageView either to the default placeholder image (if available) or to the default dimensions for the cell. Which is to say that it should *not* set the TTImageView's frame to match the downloaded image's frame because the downloaded image might be too large, and it is better to just downsample it to fit in the row).\r\n\r\nI would fix the bug myself but it seems more like a policy decision that you would be better equiped to decide.\r\n","title":"TTTableImageItemCell layout overflow","updated_at":"2009/12/21 18:49:31 -0800","closed_at":null,"user":"klazuka","labels":["bug"],"state":"open"},{"gravatar_id":"6233bc7d4890c3f9d40f1472dda4c78e","position":16.0,"number":59,"votes":1,"created_at":"2009/07/27 05:30:11 -0700","comments":4,"body":"After these changes:\r\nhttp://github.com/joehewitt/three20/commit/992ff5f9a76478c04fe2992ae7a2b092bbe3161c\r\n\r\nWhen the keyboard appears in a window which contains a tab bar, the size of the entire keyboard is subtracted from the view.

The following code from TTTableViewDelegate shows why:\r\n- (void)tableView:(UITableView*)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath: \r\n(NSIndexPath*)indexPath { \r\n  id<TTTableViewDataSource> dataSource = (id<TTTableViewDataSource>) \r\ntableView.dataSource; \r\n  id object = [dataSource tableView:tableView \r\nobjectForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath]; \r\n  if ([object isKindOfClass:[TTTableLinkedItem class]]) { \r\n    TTTableLinkedItem* item = object; \r\n    if (item.URL && [_controller shouldOpenURL:item.URL]) { \r\n      TTOpenURL(item.URL); \r\n    } \r\n...\r\n\r\nThis requires an \"item\" class and \"cell\" class to be created for any custom cells. It also prevents the \"query\" versions of TTNavigator.openURL from being called, so you can't pass objects in as part of a navigator link, only URL strings. This prevents you from, for example, opening a view with a data object directly, as you could if you instantiated the view and set the object manually.\r\n\r\nA proposed solution would be to create a protocol named something like TTLinkable or TTNavigatorAware. The protocol would have a required property, \"URL\", and an optional NSDictionary property, \"query\". This would mean that the TTTableViewDelegate code could be written as \r\n  if([object conformsToProtocol:@protocol(TTLinkable)]){\r\n    id<TTLinkable> linkable = (id<TTLinkable>) object;\r\n    if(linkable.query)\r\n      [[TTNavigator navigator] openURL:linkable.URL  query:linkable.query animated:YES];\r\n    else\r\n      [[TTNavigator navigator] openURL:linkable.URL  animated:YES];\r\n  }\r\n\r\nMigration to the new way could be as simple as just making the TTTableLinkedItem object conform to the new protocol. \r\n\r\nAs an example of how this would greatly simplify things, imagine two views: a contact list and a contact detail view. The contact list is filled with data from a remote server call. With the new system, the contact object itself could implement the TTLinkable protocol, or a custom cell object, which would be used to fill the list view. No custom \"item\" object would have to be created, only an optional custom cell if desired.

It may just be a key:\nhttp://example.com/example.php?key&key2=value\n\n- Keys are not necessarily unique:\nhttp://example.com/example.php?key=value1&key=value2\nIn this case, the value of the parameter \"key\" is BOTH \"value1\" and \"value2\".\n\nI see two options here:\na) If it turns out there are multiple values for one key, we return the multiple values in an NSArray. If there is only one value, we return it directly. Pros: leaves the common case (no multiple values) unchanged. Cons: entails a nasty isKindOfClass check to determine whether there are multiple values or not.\nb) We return all param values as NSArrays, even if they're singleton. Pros: you know that the values in the returned dictionary are always NSArrays. Cons: in the common case, you'll have to do -lastObject on every value.\n\nAs background, here's what happens with this sample URL in Python and Ruby's standard library CGI modules:\n\nhttp://example.com/path/example.php?barekey&key=value1&key=value2&singlekey=value\n\nPython (it's missing barekey which I think is a bug):\n    {'singlekey': ['value'], 'key': ['value1', 'value2']}\n\nRuby:\n    {\"barekey\"=>[nil], \"singlekey\"=>[\"value\"], \"key\"=>[\"value1\", \"value2\"]}\n\nAs you can see, they both use arrays even for singleton keys (although Python's cgi module has a separate class which assumes singleton keys). Ruby inserts an empty array as the value for barekey. Note that this is distinct from \"barekey=\", in which case it inserts an array with an empty string.\n\nI think we should follow Ruby's model in Three20.

However, there's currently no support for other forms of authentication challenge, such as client certificates or server trust. In my particular case, I needed to be able to support a self-signed certificate on the server side.

The default queue implementation just returns false, so the overall behavior of the library will be unchanged.

The method is iterating over the files constituting TT's on-disk cache, and touching all of them. As far as I can tell, TT enforces no upper bound on the number of files, which means that as you continue to use the cache, this problem only gets worse.\r\n\r\nHere's my justification for why this method shouldn't exist:\r\n\r\n- There is no way to stop it from being slow. The program is I/O-bound in this method, and iterating over thousands of files is going to be expensive no matter what.\r\n\r\n- If you're calling it at the application level, it's very likely that you're doing something wrong. When you call it, you are throwing out the entire TT cache, when it's likely that you could be invalidating more selectively instead. This lets the app do less work invalidating and less work re-fetching.\r\n\r\nThere is a use case for a method like this, which is to clear out the entire cache unconditionally when, for example, the user logs out. In this case, though, the desired action is not invalidation but total deletion; the files should be deleted, not simply marked as old. My preference here would be to create a method with a different name that does this. Ideally the method could be capable of running safely in a non-main thread, but I'm not sure how feasible this is.","title":"-[TTURLCache invalidateAll] should go away","updated_at":"2010/08/11 17:55:06 -0700","closed_at":null,"user":"oyamauchi","labels":[],"state":"open"},{"gravatar_id":"1ac8287df1ad9b81d793f1a597b6eebc","position":257.0,"number":262,"votes":1,"created_at":"2010/08/16 07:37:07 -0700","comments":0,"body":"It's all in the title.

Two classes A and B add themselves to a typical three20 non-retaining delegate array.\n2. Delegate notification happens, copies the delegate array and starts enumerating A and B.\n3.
